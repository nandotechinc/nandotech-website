# NandoTech Public Website

Re-work of NandoTech website into Hugo site

- Extremely efficient blog engine allowing us to be agile and make site changes easily while not sacrificing design
- Easily add/remove projects, team members & other relevant company info
- Much better as a front-end sales website than our current site and much faster & more lightweight.
- Can be hosted anywhere that hosts static sites

### Deployable site will live in own branch (gh-pages if we use github).


_Still in progress..._
